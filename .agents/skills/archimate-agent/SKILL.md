This is the canonical policy skill for ArchiMate operations.
The full canonical policy is maintained in
`.github/agents/archimate architect.agent.md` (relative to workspace root).

Load and follow that file for:
- strict prompt snippet
- intent routing matrix
- no-side-effect rules
- runtime drawio guardrail behavior

Use this file as metadata/entrypoint and treat the GitHub agent file as the single source of truth.
